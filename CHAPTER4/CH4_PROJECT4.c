#include <stdio.h>

//Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays it in octal (base 8):
//Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953
//In octal, your number is: 03641
//The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits are sufficient. Hint: To
//convert the number to octal, first divide it by 8; the remainder is the last digit of the octal
//number (1, in this case). Then divide the original number by 8 and repeat the process to
//arrive at the next-to-last digit. (print f is capable of displaying numbers in base 8, as we'll
//see in Chapter 7, so there's actually an easier way to write this program.)
