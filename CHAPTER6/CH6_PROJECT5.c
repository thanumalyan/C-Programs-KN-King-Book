//Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that displays a two-digit
//number with its digits reversed. Generalize the program so that the number can have one,
//two, three, or more digits. Hint: Use a do loop that repeatedly divides the number by 10,
//stopping when it reaches 0.

int main(void)
{
    int num;
    int i;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    do 
    {
        printf("%d", num % 10);
        num /= 10;
    } while (num != 0);

    return 0;
   
    
}
