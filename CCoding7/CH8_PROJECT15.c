//One of the oldest known encryption techniques is the Caesar cipher, attributed to Julius Caesar.
//It involves replacing each letter in a message with another letter that is a fixed number of
//positions later in the alphabet. (If the replacement would go past the letter Z, the cipher
//"wraps around" to the beginning of the alphabet. For example, if each letter is replaced by
//the letter two positions after it, then Y would be replaced by A, and Z would be replaced by
//B.) Write a program that encrypts a message using a Caesar cipher. The user will enter the
//message to be encrypted and the shift amount (the number of positions by which letters
//should be shifted):
//Enter message to be encrypted: Go ahead, make my day.
//Enter shift amount (1-25): 3
//Encrypted message: Jr dkhdg, pdnh pb gdb.
//Notice that the program can decrypt a message if the user enters 26 minus the original key:
//Enter message to be encrypted: Jr dkhdg, pdnh pb gdb.
//Enter shift amount (1-25): 23
//Encrypted message: Go ahead, make my day.
//You may assume that the message does not exceed 80 characters. Characters other than letters should be left unchanged. Lower-case letters remain lower-case when encrypted, and
//upper-case letters remain upper-case. Hint: To handle the wrap-around problem, use the
//expression ((ch- 'A') +n) % 26 + 'A' to calculate the encrypted version of an uppercase letter, where ch stores the letter and n stores the shift amount. (You'll need a similar
//expression for lower-case letters.)

int main(void)
{
    char message[80];
    int ch;
    int shift_amount, i = 0, len;

    printf("Enter message to be encrypted: ");
    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n') message[i++] = ch;
    

    len = i;

    printf("Enter shift amount: ");
    scanf("%d", &shift_amount);

    printf("Encrypted message: ");

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {

        ch = message[i];

        if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') putchar( ((ch - 'A') + shift_amount) % 26 + 'A' );
        else if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') putchar( ((ch - 'a') + shift_amount) % 26 + 'a' );
        else putchar(ch);
    }

    printf("\n");
