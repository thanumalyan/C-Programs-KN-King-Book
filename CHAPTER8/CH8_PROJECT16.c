//Write a program that tests whether two words are anagrams (permutations of the same letters):
//Enter first word: smartest
//Enter second word: mattress
//The words are anagrams.
//Enter first word: dumbest
//Enter second word: stumble
//The words are not anagrams.
//Write a loop that reads the first word, character by character, using an array of 26 integers to
//keep track of how many times each letter has been seen. (For example, after the word smartest has been read, the array should contain the values 1 00010000000100001220
//00000, reflecting the fact that smartest contains one a, one e, one m, one r, two s's and
//two t's.) Use another loop to read the second word, except this time decrementing the corresponding array element as each letter is read. Both loops should ignore any characters that
//aren't letters, and both should treat upper-case letters in the same way as lower-case letters.
//After the second word has been read, use a third loop to check whether all the elements in
//the array are zero. If so, the words are anagrams. Hint: You may wish to use functions from
//<ctype.h>, such as isalpha and tolower.
